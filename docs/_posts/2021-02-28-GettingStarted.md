If you want to start learning about this beautiful world, I recommend you get a hold of some items.

- Raspberry Pi 4 starter kit comes with everything you need to get started (the actual computer, the micro SD card, and power supply). I got the 4GB RAM version. [Amazon.ca](https://www.amazon.ca/gp/product/B07XLMVYJJ/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o05_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1)

- Freenove kit has a ton of components and a book to guide you through. [Amazon.ca](https://www.amazon.ca/gp/product/B06W54L7B5/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1)

- My sight is not what it used to be, so I also had to get a 10X magnifier to see the tiny pieces. [Amazon.ca](https://www.amazon.ca/gp/product/B074C4D9TG/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o01_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1)

- [optional] An oscilloscope is indispensable to “see” the electrons flowing through the wires, but those things are expensive. A good one is at least a few hundred dollars. I was able to find this little device which is doing an excellent job for what I need. [Amazon.ca](https://www.amazon.ca/gp/product/B0892KBP7P/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o09_s01?ie=UTF8&psc=1)
