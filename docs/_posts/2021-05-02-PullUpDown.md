title: Pull-Up, Pull-Down Resistors
---

When working with electronic logic circuits, pull-up/pull-down resistors are used to ensure a known state for a signal.

Digital electronics have two different values: True/False, High/Low, On/Off or 0/1. But in reality, we are working with analog voltages ranging from 0 volts to VCC volts (3.3 volts in the current project). How is that important? Well, letâ€™s take a look at this circuit:
