title: GPIO Pins

The Raspberry Pi board has 40 pins that we can use to interact with the world, but there is no standard way of referring to them! _Technically there are few standard ways_

There is tons of literature on the pin names, I guess everybody finds the lack of a single standard way of referrencing them confusing, but the image below is the one I like the best, it comes from the actual <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/usage/gpio/" target="_blank">Raspberry Pi documentation</a>

This image shows the name, or names for the pins, and inside the small circles there is number indicating the physical location of such pins on the Raspberry Pi board. You may need to click on the image to zoom in and read those names/numbers ;-)

Raspberry Pi can provide you with some of this information if you run the `gpio readall` or the `pinout` commands from the terminal. I used that information and other pieces of information collected from different places, including <a href="http://abyz.me.uk/rpi/pigpio/" target="_blank">this</a>, and I have built the table below which hopefuly helps you. It sure has helped me...

Rather than having to do a conversion every time, I have created <a href="https://github.com/eltoroit/etRPIO/blob/master/pins.js" target="_blank">this JavaScript file</a> which I just use on my projects.
