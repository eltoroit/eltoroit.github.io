Hi,

Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) on a Raspberry Pi using Node.js

A few weeks ago I shared with you guys that I had started a new blog on Rasberry Pi and Node.js. Today I want to share that I have created three new articles discussing how to work with Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) on the Raspberry Pi using Node.js libraries (RPIO and PIGPIO).
