title: Analog To Digital Conversion (I<sup>2</sup>C)
---

How can the Raspberry Pi, being an all-digital device, read an analog signal? Use an _Analog-to-Digital Converter (ADC)_. This article discusses why we need those converters, and we focus on I<sup>2</sup>C ADCs.

In the last couple of articles, we discussed Pulse-Width Modulation (PWM), which simulates an analog signal required to dim an LED using a digital output from the Raspberry Pi. But we were not genuinely converted a digital signal to an analog one! We were only producing a high or low value (on/off, 1/0, true/false) for a predefined amount of time (duty cycle), and the analog circuit "believed," by averaging the values, that it was an analog signal. Today we are converting an analog signal to a digital one!

Before going into how this conversion takes place, we need to understand a couple of things.

# Digital Vs. Analog Signals

An _analog signal_ is a continuous signal that represents some physical measurement. Most signals in life (speed, length, weight, brightness, sound, voltage, current, power, resistance, and many more) are analog. For example, think about the speed of a car. A fast car can go from 0 to 60 in few seconds. It does not matter how fast the car is; the speed will not change instantaneously from 0 to 60!

A _digital signal_ represents data as a sequence of different values at any point in time. It can only take one of a fixed number of values depending on the resolution. For example if we have a signal with an 8 bit resolution, then we could obtain 2<sup>8</sup> (256) values ranging from 0x00 (00000000) to 0xFF (11111111). More importantly, those values can change instantaneously!

# Analog-to-Digital Conversion

Computers, like the Raspberry Pi, work with digital signals. If you want to build a system that monitors an analog voltage, you need to use an _Analog-to-Digital Converter_. The ADC converts an analog signal (voltage or current) into a digital number representing the magnitude of the measured value. By the way, a _digital-to-analog converter (DAC)_ performs the reverse function, but we are not discussing those in this article.

There are several factors you need to consider when selecting the correct ADC for your projects, including:

- Interfaces:
  - ADC chips on the Raspberry Pi can use either I<sup>2</sup>C (Inter-Integrated-Circuit) or SPI (Serial Peripheral Interface) bus protocols.
  - This article uses the board provided in the [Frenove kit](https://www.amazon.ca/gp/product/B06W54L7B5/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1), which uses [ADS7830 ADC chip](https://www.ti.com/lit/ds/symlink/ads7830.pdf?ts=1622913938265), and it uses an I<sup>2</sup>C protocol.
  - SPI is faster than I<sup>2</sup>C, but it limits the number of devices the bus can accept. For the Raspberry Pi, the limit is 2 devices.
  - I<sup>2</sup>C is slower than SPI, but you can connect many more devices (slaves) to the I<sup>2</sup>C master device as long as the slave addresses don't conflict.
- Number of channels:
  - The number of inputs you can connect to the boards.
  - The [ADS7830 ADC chip](https://www.ti.com/lit/ds/symlink/ads7830.pdf?ts=1622913938265) has 8 channels.
- Sensitivity
  - Measured by its bit rate.
  - A higher bit rate means that the chip has a higher resolution for measuring the input voltage, but this comes at the expense of the speed of the readings.
  - The [ADS7830 ADC chip](https://www.ti.com/lit/ds/symlink/ads7830.pdf?ts=1622913938265) has an 8-bit resolution, which means it can have 2<sup>8</sup> (256) values from 0x00 to 0xFF.
- Sample Rate
  - The speed at which the ADC chip can sample and report the input values.
  - The [ADS7830 ADC chip](https://www.ti.com/lit/ds/symlink/ads7830.pdf?ts=1622913938265) has a sampling rate of 70kHz.

The information for the ADS7830 ADC comes from this [datasheet](https://www.ti.com/lit/ds/symlink/ads7830.pdf?ts=1622913938265).

# Project

We are going to build this simple circuit.

![First Phase](/assets/blog/2021-06-06/Project.png)

The potentiometer is going to work as a voltage divider. As we change the resistance value, the voltage detected on pin A0 of the ADS7830 ADC chip changes. The chip converts the value from 0 (representing 0 volts) to 255 (representing 3.3 volts), and the Raspberry Pi receives this value on the SDA (GPIO2) pin. Our code takes that value, displays it on the console and sends it to the class that controls the LED, which we discussed in this article [Hardware-based PWM with RPIO]({% link _posts/2021-05-30-HardwarePWM-RPIO.md %}).

# Voltage Divider

Before moving to the code, we need to understand what we are testing

![Simple series circuit](/assets/blog/2021-06-06/SimpleCircuit.png)

Thanks to the [Ohm's law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ohm%27s_law) we know that in a simple circuit like the one displayed above the current is related to the voltage and the total resitance of the circuit. This relation can be calculated using this very well known triangle.

![VIR](/assets/blog/2021-06-06/VIR.png)

Because this circuit is a series circuit, the total resistance in this circuit is the addition of the two individual resistors (2KΩ + 8KΩ = 10KΩ). The current in the circuit is calculated by dividing the voltage by the total resistance (3.3 volts / 10KΩ = 330μA). If we keep the total resistance fixed (10KΩ), we can change the values for the resistors (1+9, 2+8, 3+7, ...) and the current will be maintained the same (330μA).

We are connecting a voltmeter across the second resistor to measure the voltage that is drop across it. Because the current (330μA) and the value for the second resistor (8KΩ) are know, we can find out what is the value of the voltage dropped across the resistor by multiplying those two values (330μA \* 8KΩ = 2.64 volts).

We are using a 10KΩ potentiometer (variable resistor) which allows us to change the values for the individual resistors but keeping the total resistor fixed. As you can see in the video below the voltage dropped changes. We are going to measure the actual value in this project.

In our project we are using a potentiometer to manually change the resistance but this is a very commonly used technique, and you could change a potentiometer for a thermistor (to find the tempetature) or photoresistor (to find the brightness) or for many other cool projects.

# Configure Raspberry Pi

First, we have to configure the Raspberry Pi to enable the I<sup>2</sup>C protocol.

- Type `sudo raspi config` on the terminal window.
- Select `Interfacing Options`.
- Select `I2C`.
- Answer `Yes` when asked to enable I<sup>2</sup>C.
- Close the configuration tool
- Execute this command: `i2cdetect -y 1`

You should see a table like this:

![I2C Table](/assets/blog/2021-06-06/I2C_Table.png)

That is great, I<sup>2</sup>C is working, and we know the address that our ADC is going to use (0x4b).
