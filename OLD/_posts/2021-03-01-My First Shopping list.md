title: My First Shopping list
---

As mentioned before, on Christmas 2020 I decided to start a journey in the wonderful world of robotics and IoT. What is the first thing you do before you embark on a journey? You go shopping!

That was exactly what I did, so I head over to Amazon and I purchase few things that have been very important to let me start this journey. If you want to adventure on this fascinating world, you will have to get some of these items too.

- [Raspberry PI 4 starter kit](https://www.amazon.ca/gp/product/B07XLMVYJJ/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o05_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1), which came with everything you need to get started including the “computer”, Micro SD Card, and Power Supply

- A kit with a ton of parts and a book to guide you through, after a lot of research I decided on this one: [Freenove Ultimate Starter Kit for Raspberry Pi 4B](https://www.amazon.ca/gp/product/B06W54L7B5/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1)

- (optional) An oscilloscope is indispensable to understand the electrons that are flowing through the wires but those things are expensive. A good one is at least a few hundred dollars, but I was able to find this [little/inexpensive oscilloscope](https://www.amazon.ca/gp/product/B0892KBP7P/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o09_s01?ie=UTF8&psc=1) which is doing a great job for what I need. I did not wanted to spend few hundred dollars if I was not sure that I was going to enjoy this journey. I will soon be moving up to a better oscilloscope!

- (optional) I am old, and my sight is not what it used to be before, so I had to also get a hold of a [10X magnifier](https://www.amazon.ca/gp/product/B074C4D9TG/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o01_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1) to see the tiny pieces

Other things that I purchased, but you may not need them, at least not for your first purchase ;-)
