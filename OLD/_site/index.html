          <p>You may have read some of my blogs on Salesforce development/architecture, but this year I decided to embark on a new hobby: <strong>Robotics and IoT</strong>! So this blog series will be a bit different than the ones you regularly read on Salesforce development, hopefully you enjoy these ones too.</p>

<p>In order to start learning about this awesome new world, I decided to purchase a few things on Christmas 2020 from Amazon including a kit with a ton of parts and a good book to guide me. The Freenove kit that I acquired has a great set of components, and the projects are simple and work quite well. The concepts are incremental, starting with a simple LED and evolving to add switches and more advanced components. Once I had acquired those items, I was ready to start my journey, and let me tell you, it has been an awesome ride!</p>

<p>I decided that if I really wanted to learn, I was going to have to challenge myself, so I came up with a great idea: I am going to build the circuits they have in the book but I am going to write the code using JavaScript (nodeJS). The kit comes with code samples in C++ and Python, so I can use those samples as guides.</p>

<p>This was a great idea because I have to fully understand the sample code they have so that I can translate it to JavaScript. The book has some basic explanations of how things work but it does not go into a lot of depth and sometimes they oversimplify things… but having to translate the code to another language requires me to go into a lot of depth on the information provided and learn not only how it’s done but why it’s done. So the book, together with Google, has been a great educational experience.</p>

<p>But it was easier said than done, especially at the beginning of my journey. After a lot of research (trial and error, and plenty of googling) I found a couple of good npm libraries named <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/rpio">RPIO</a> and <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/pigpio">PIGPIO</a> that work quite well with the Raspberry PI and Javascript, and so far it has everything I need.</p>

<p>If I had to choose just one of those libraries, I think I would use <strong>PIGPIO</strong> because it’s more complete, for example <strong>RPIO</strong> only does hardware based PWM but <strong>PIGPIO</strong> does software based PWM which allows me to use more pins with PWM. I will write a blog later on this later.</p>

<p>There is another interesting npm library named <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/johnny-five">Johny-Five</a> which seems promising because it simplifies a lot of the code that needs to be written, but that is precisely the reason I have stayed away from that… it does too much hand-holding and I feel that at this stage it would not help me learn as much.</p>

<p>I will start the new series of blogs sharing some of the knowledge I have acquired while working on some of the projects.So stay tuned, and join in the discovery of this new fascinating world.</p>
